# Pharmacy automatization

This project is made for university work. Theme is automatization of pharmacy. I need to use SQL database for doing it.

## Layout of project:
- cmd - Small main function(s)
- internal - All business logic 
- pkg - Things than is too small to move on different repository, or just wrap over wrap :) May just copy to other projects
- configs - config for start up project
- migrations - db migration for project
- docs - any kind of API or description of project
- elk - docker-compose file with setup elk stack. Just for fun
